  //    To achieve this, we set bits COM2A1 and COM2B1 to high.

  //    To achieve this, we set bits WGM21 and WGM20 to high.

  //    OCR2A value instead of the default 255. To achieve this, we set bit
  //    WGM22 to high.
  // 2. Set the prescaler divisor to 1, so that our counter will be fed with
  //    the clock's full frequency (16MHz). To achieve this, we set CS20 to
  //    high (and keep CS21 and CS22 to low by not setting them).

  // This is the duty cycle. Think of it as the last value of the counter our
  // output will remain high for. Can't be greater than OCR2A of course. A
